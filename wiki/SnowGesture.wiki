= SnowGestures =

This class makes it easier for developers to implement simple gestures. The class recognizes 4 different directions: Up, 
Down, Left and Right.

= How to implement =

First, ofcourse, initialise an instance of `SnowGesture`. Override the `boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event)` of your Activity and have it call `SnowGesture.touchEvent(event)`, where event is the MotionEvent from the `onTouchEvent()`.
And to get the recognition to work you have two options:
 * Use a `SnowGesture.GestureListener` to register a gesture and it accompanying listener.
 * Use a `SnowGesture.GestureCompleteListener` to implement the recognition yourself.

== Gesture string ==

A gesture string consists of characters which indicate a direction: U for up, D for down, R for right and L for left. The gesture string should be in upper case, but the `registerGesture()` converts it to upper case in case you didn't already.
An example:
{{{
String gestureString = "LRU";
}}}
Means first go Left then Right and then Up.
In case the gesture string contains unknow direction characters, the `registerGesture()` will return false.

This is a very simple (yet working :) ) example:
